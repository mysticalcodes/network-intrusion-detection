# network-intrusion-detection
an AI and DL based model to filter the network traffic
This project implements a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using a labeled traffic dataset to classify network activity as either attack or normal.

Features
-Preprocessed traffic dataset with labeled classes.
-RNN-based deep learning model for sequential data analysis.
-Predicts network intrusions with high accuracy.
Achieved an accuracy of 98%.
